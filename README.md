# BloomAir
BloomAir is an IoT powered solution for a cleaner and conscious living developed at the Participatory Resilience '22 hackathon at ETH ZÃ¼rich.
The project is three things
1. Atmospheric sensors housed in a 3D printed flower vase, whose readings are intuitively relayed to the user by means of a "dead"/"alive" fake plant.
2. A client side app and an alert system. The app lets users of BloomAir devices check the air quality measurements at their home from wherever they are.
Based on data from neighboring BloomAir devices, users are notified of a possible air quality threat based on predictions of a machine learning algorithm.
3. An analytics dashboard: We aggregate data from all BloomAir devices, and visualize it on Google Maps to provide a big picture view of indoor air quality trends.
Also shown are any emerging anomalies in real time.
